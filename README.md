### User Stories 
 As a user I would like to be able to sign in, and be able to navigate easily throughout the web-store. Also I would like to be able to add the t-shirts I like to my cart. I would also like to leave, edit, and delete comments on the t-shirts design that I enjoyed. In my cart I want the sum of the t-shirts to be given.
 
 ### Technologies Used
 Python, Django, Javascript, React.JS, Bulma, HTML, CSS.
 
 ### Goals
 Have a landing page where user can easily navigate to their next decision. Nav bar that is fixed to the top of the screen.  Have users where, their carts are saved, items can be put and taken out of your cart . Comments can be made, edited, and deleted on t-shirts. Give the subtotal of the t-shirts in the cart, and a carts page where it displays all the itemâ€™s in your cart.

 ### What's left? 
 Responsiveness, make the web-store mobile friendly. Have a nice animation in the landing page. Have several pages of t-shirts, and more categorize than t-shirts(like socks). The user can update and delete their profile. Have taxes rate depending on where you live. Dark and light mode to the web-store.  Profile picture for the user. Search Bar to search the design.
